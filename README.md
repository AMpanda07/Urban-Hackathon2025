The app is built on robust technology (*React/Angular* for the front end, *Node.js* for the backend, and *Firestore* for real-time data). It sustains itself by charging a *Small Fee* (10-15%) from the Helper *only* when a job is successfully completed. This structure supports both earning opportunities and the creation of a skill-sharing community.
